## 📌 Overview

Traditional network security assumes that users and devices inside the network can be trusted. However, modern cyber threats frequently originate from compromised internal accounts and insider threats.

This project implements a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** model where every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated regardless of network location.

The framework demonstrates secure enterprise access management through Docker-based deployment and role-based authorization controls.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Implement Zero Trust Architecture principles in a simulated enterprise environment.
2. Enforce authentication and authorization before resource access.
3. Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies.
4. Demonstrate Docker-based security deployment.
5. Simulate insider and external threat scenarios.
6. Evaluate security effectiveness and access restrictions.

---

## 🛡️ Zero Trust Principles

### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify

Every user and device must be authenticated before access.

### 2. Least Privilege Access

Users receive only the permissions required for their role.

### 3. Continuous Verification

Access requests are continuously validated.

### 4. Assume Breach

The system is designed with the assumption that attackers may already exist inside the network.

### 5. Micro-Segmentation

Resources are logically separated to reduce attack surfaces.

## 🔒 Security Components

| Component         | Purpose                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Authentication    | Verify user identity          |
| Authorization     | Grant approved access         |
| RBAC              | Role-based permissions        |
| Session Control   | Secure user sessions          |
| Access Policies   | Restrict unauthorized actions |
| Threat Monitoring | Detect suspicious activity    |
| Docker Isolation  | Containerized deployment      |

---

## 🔬 Methodology

1. Design enterprise security architecture.
2. Create Dockerized application environment.
3. Implement authentication workflows.
4. Configure RBAC policies.
5. Deploy employee and administrator dashboards.
6. Simulate cyber attack scenarios.
7. Evaluate effectiveness of security controls.
8. Document findings and recommendations.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

### Authentication Layer

* User login verification
* Credential validation
* Session management

### Authorization Layer

* Role-based access control
* Access restrictions
* Dashboard separation

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t zta-security .
```

```bash
docker run -d -p 9090:80 zta-security
```

```bash
docker ps
```

Application URL:

```text
http://localhost:9090
```

## ⚠️ Threat Simulations

### Insider Threat Scenario

**Attack:**
Employee attempts to access administrator resources.

**Result:**
Access denied through RBAC enforcement.

---

### External Threat Scenario

**Attack:**
Unauthorized user attempts direct dashboard access through URL manipulation.

**Result:**
User redirected to authentication page.

---

### Privilege Escalation Attempt

**Attack:**
Normal user attempts administrative actions.

**Result:**
Request blocked by authorization policies.

---

## 📊 Results

| Test Scenario               | Result   |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| Authentication Validation   | ✅ Passed |
| Authorization Enforcement   | ✅ Passed |
| RBAC Controls               | ✅ Passed |
| Dashboard Isolation         | ✅ Passed |
| URL Manipulation Prevention | ✅ Passed |
| Insider Threat Protection   | ✅ Passed |
| Docker Deployment           | ✅ Passed |

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. Zero Trust significantly reduces unauthorized access risks.
2. RBAC effectively enforces least-privilege principles.
3. Continuous verification improves enterprise security posture.
4. Docker provides secure and isolated deployment environments.
5. Insider threat risks can be minimized through strict access control policies.
6. Authentication alone is insufficient without proper authorization controls.
